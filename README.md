# ALiVE
ALiVE is a simple open source 3D rendering engine in PHP 5.

# Caution
I wrote this engine when I started learning 3D geometry. Therefore, the code is bad, slow, and doesn't support the
features you're expecting it to support apart from the bare minimum. Please do **not** use this code for anything
in a production environment.

# License

# Reading
Run the file test.html initially to see a simple demo. Then open up index.php, read the code, and try to modify it.
